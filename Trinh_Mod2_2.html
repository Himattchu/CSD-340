	<h1> Assignment 2.3 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
	<h2> Who am I </h2>
	<p class="intro"> <span class="sentence">Hello my name is Matthew Trinh.</span> I am born and raised in California, 
however my family is from Vietnam which indeed makes me Vietnamese. 
I also happen to be Catholic. To which I should introduce you by my full name 
Saint Francis Xavier Matthew Dang Khoa Trinh. <p>
	<p> To break up my name that is my Saint name followed by first, middle and then last. 
Apparantly my parents chose the name Matthew because it means the gift of God and i guess im a gift to them. 
In my immediate family I have my father, mother and 1 older sister. However, I am very close to my extended
family and consider them to also be immediate family. They consist of granpa, 2 aunts, 1 uncle, and 2 younger cousins. <p>
	<p> Currently I work for the Walt Disney Company and have been with them for almost 6 years.
I currently work as an order cook full time and while I used to be a lead, I dropped my status so that 
I may focus on myself and finish up a degree. Between working full time and doing school full time 
I haven't had too much time to do other things. <p>
	<p> Between managing school and work I am figuring out my finances and trying to live a healither
lifstyle. Those activities have pretty much become my hobbies. Don't get me wrong 
learning about the finicial world has been pretty fun and i can't wait to get it handled so that I 
may get the opprotunities to travel. <p>
